\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{ch:conclusion}

\section{Summary}

This project proposes a \textbf{unified, intelligence-driven security assessment framework} that bridges predictive analysis and practical validation. By integrating \textbf{threat modeling}, \textbf{penetration testing}, and \textbf{threat intelligence}, the approach empowers organizations to \textbf{prioritize real risks}, \textbf{respond faster}, and \textbf{continuously strengthen} their defenses in an ever-evolving threat landscape.

The eight-layer TIBSA platform architecture demonstrates how modern security tools and methodologies can be integrated to provide comprehensive, automated, and continuous security assessment capabilities.

\section{Contributions}

The main contributions of this project include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A comprehensive framework integrating threat modeling with penetration testing
    \item An eight-layer architecture design for the TIBSA platform
    \item Integration of 18 different security tools and services
